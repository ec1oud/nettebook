crd2sql.c is a simple C program which takes as input a Windows 3.1 Cardfile
compatible .crd file and outputs sql commands to insert the information 
from the "cards" into the "cardfile" portion of the NetteBook database
schema.

It is based on a crd2txt program by Hannu Aronsson <Hannu.Aronsson@iki.fi>.
I simply modified it to output the SQL commands instead of plain text.
Thanks Hannu!

To compile it, use this command line:

gcc crd2sql.c -o crd2sql

I didn't see much point in writing a Makefile to automate that.  :-)
The binary that comes in the tarball was compiled on my Debian "potato"
system with gcc 2.91.66-2 and glibc 2.1.  If you have a different libc
you will need to recompile for sure.

When you run it without arguments it will tell you its usage:

Usage: crd2sql file.crd person_id category

"file.crd" is your original .crd file.  "person_id" is the entity ID in the
Nettebook database that the cards will "belong" to.  To find out what
that is, you will have to set up NetteBook, insert yourself as a "person"
entry, give yourself access by means of a "user" entry, and then you
can get the entity_id that the database assigned to you and use that
as the person_id paramter to crd2sql.  "category" is the category that
you want the cards from this file to be put into.  If you were in the
habit of keeping multiple .crd files around for multiple purposes, then
just use a separate category for each file and you can keep them separate
and neatly labeled.

Well when you run crd2sql with these parameters it will output sql 
commands to stdout; so to capture them for later insertion into the
database, pipe it to a file:

crd2sql my.crd 1 phone-numbers > phone.sql

for example.  For educational and sanity-checking purposes you might
want to look at the file that was created.  Then, to insert into the 
database you should be able to do something like

psql -f phone.sql nettebook

if "nettebook" is the name of the database.

Have fun!
