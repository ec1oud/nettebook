<P>...is an Open Source web-based PIM (personal information manager) under development.  </P>
<h2>Features</h2>
<P>So far, it's mostly for contact management.  You can use NetteBook to keep track
of people, places, things, relationships between them, means of contacting
them, conversations, and comments.
There are also free-form "cards" for random bits of data.  Calendars 
would be the next major use that will probably be added.</P>
<P>There are many PIM applications for desktop machines, and proprietary ones
on PDAs, but NetteBook lets you access the information via any web browser,
as well as synchronize with the Palm PDA.  It's intended for the "power user"
with a home web server, or for a small business, or perhaps for friends
and family to share.</P>

<h2>Motivation and history</h2>
<img align=right src=images/windingroad.gif>
<P><B>Warning:</B> Rambling ahead</P>
<P>My motivation in writing this was to replace my hopelessly outdated collections
of Windows cardfiles which I was using to store my personal phone numbers
and addresses (about 150 of them).  (This bad habit started in
1992 or so when I got my 386 and had enough power and memory to run
Windows.)  But it has been a couple years since I used Windows much.
I have a laptop which still runs 3.1 and once in a 
while I have had to fire it up to look up an address.  (BTW I'm waiting for 
compressed ext2 to get finished so I can install Linux on that laptop.
It only has 40 megs HD.)  I didn't want to manually 
re-enter all that data, and certainly didn't want to use any more 
here-today-gone-tomorrow formats.  Furthermore I've always been disgusted 
with the way most contact 
management/PIM type packages are too limiting; they may give you only one
slot to fill in a person's phone number, and another for the fax, and another
for the cell phone.  But people don't have fixed kinds and quantities of
telephony devices so these fixed fields would have to keep changing over time.
More likely the author would get bored with updating his program and it would
become unmaintained and obsolete.  If there were updates, no doubt there
would be file format incompatibilities (if memory serves, even .crd format
was different between Windows 3.1 for DOS and NT 3.51.  After NT 3.51 it was
dropped with no obvious replacement.)</P>
<P>So in late 1998 I remembered having seen somewhere on the 'net a 
program to convert .crd files to plain text.  I started thinking about the perfect
PIM application (which, being a perfectionist by nature, could ultimately
be nothing less than an expert system so that it could act on the information
or answer questions as well as just store it).  Forcing myself into some
moderation I decided it would be a good start if I could just import the
individual cards in the cardfile into a database, and migrate them into
something else later.  But I couldn't just not think about what would 
come later so as another intermediate step I designed a schema that would
store both the plain cards and the individual fields such as 
last name, first name, phone numbers and email addresses.</P>
<P>The general-purpose "cards" table simply contains a category
(8 characters just like DOS file names, corresponding to which file the cards
came from), an index line (like the top line of a 3x5 index card), and a body
(unlimited amounts of text).  I found the crd-to-text converter which turned
out to be a freeware C program, and modified it
to instead write SQL statements for inserting the cards into my database.
And presto, with a few commands I had imported all of my old .crd files.</P>
<P>Then I installed PHP3 on my home gateway/web server and started writing a 
simple front-end for viewing and editing the cards.  It was really easy and
yielded immediate useful results.  About that time I needed a new job and
used it successfully to manage info on a dozen-and-a-half headhunters
and other job-hunting leads.  Once while at an interview, I needed to access
some information in there and so I used the headhunter's computer to do so.
Afterwards, I left the browser open, and she would have been 
free to rummage around as she pleased for that browsing session, after I
left, if she was the snoopy type.  Oops.  <code>:-)</code></P>
<P>After I got the new job, I could afford a Palm and so began to think
of how this database could be integrated with the one on the Palm.
Unfortunately the built-in phone/address book thingy has a limited number
of fields, but at least it allows you to select from all known varieties
of phone numbers and use various combinations of them, and there are 4
fields which can be renamed.  But why oh why are there only 4?!?!  I can
easily think of many more needs than that: home page URLs (multiple of
course), anniversary, birthday, what kind of car they drive, favorite 
color, ham callsign, ICQ UID, etc.
Not only that but if you rename field 2 to Home Page then field 2 is always
reserved for Home Page whether or not a particular contact has one or 
none or several.  And if you beam a card with a field 2 value to another
Palm which has renamed field 2 to something else, then what?  I don't know
what happens but there are only two solutions that I can see and neither
one is pretty.  I simply can't believe the shortsightedness of these
guys, especially with their Newton background.  Well anyway... I think
I can cobble together a conduit which will at least transfer the 
most important (in the eyes of Palm Inc. of course) fields back and
forth between the two.  I will probably do that in Java.</P>
<P>I also did some preliminary experiments with 
<a href=http://www-sor.inria.fr/~java/tools/jlex/>JLex</a>, the Java
lexer generator (not having had any experience with that kind of stuff)
and managed to write a parser which has surprisingly resilient, intelligent-
looking behavior for purposes of extracting phone numbers and text
which is perceived as being descriptive of the phone number.  It 
recognizes all forms of phone numbers that I know of (including foreign
ones; with or without the plus in front; with or without dashes between
the segments, or similar punctuation; with or without parentheses around
the area code; etc.)  Text which is to the right or left of the phone
number, or text which occurs before it, followed by a colon, is taken 
as text which describes the purpose of that phone number.  The goal here
is to write a program which can extract data from general-purpose 
"cardfile" records in the database, and insert them into the contact
management tables.  Most likely this will be done interactively card
by card with the user verifying that everything got picked out properly
before committing the changes.  What's left to make it possible of course
is to recognize and extract email addresses, physical addresses, and URLs.
It needs to be incorporated into a servlet.
Leftover text can be dumped into a comment field (BTW, entities can have
an unlimited number of comments too).  But I realized I was getting ahead
of myself (as usual) until the PHP scripts 
for various views and editing capabilities on the PIM tables
are done.  So the parser thing is on the back shelf for now.</P>
<P>Ultimately I think Java servlets are a better idea than PHP3 for portability 
reasons, and because the parser thingy needs Java anyway (I wouldn't do it
in PHP3 obviously).  So I might redo all the PHP scripts as servlets
sooner or later.  In the meantime I kinda wanted to get it hobbling along
well enough that I can start using the PIM tables rather than the plain
cards for my day-to-day PIM-kind-of-stuff.  It's getting close.  But 
I think the Palm conduit is my next priority, and then the parser (so 
I can finally migrate those darn cards automagically) and then rewriting
the PHP scripts.  Somewhere in there a vcard codec would be nice.  I
plan on having a link that says "upload a vcard" and your browser will
prompt you for the file, and send it to the servlet, which assimilates it.
Similarly you should be able to save any contact as a vcard.</P>
<P>After basic contact management there are other things a PIM needs to
do, for instance calendaring.  Another can of worms considering how many
half-ass calendars are out there.  Well at least some of those have decent
groupware features so I need to develop some concepts to make that work
really well too.  The contact management stuff is sortof designed for 
multiple users (based on who logs in) but I'm not sure it's robust enough
and right now there is no way to view someone else's stuff without logging
in as them.  That's OK for most of us but maybe not OK for collaborating
salespeople or something.  Of course relational databases don't map well
onto federated hierarchies either.  That's what 
<a href=http://whatis.com/ldap.htm>LDAP</a> is for.  In the beginning
I toyed with implementing the whole thing on top of 
<a href=http://http://www.openldap.org/software/man.cgi?query=slapd>slapd</a> instead of 
<a href=http://www.postgresql.org/>PostgreSQL</a> but decided against it on the grounds that existing LDAP implementations tend to fill me with a sense of 
<a href=directory-vs-database.html>
fear and loathing</a> and because the relational database is a superset of the tree
structure's functionality.  (It's an evolutionary step too, which makes
me wonder why directories are so popular nowadays.  Hierarchical databases
from the 60's got replaced with relational ones, remember?)  I think it would
be possible to implement an LDAP-compliant shell which accepts queries but
gets the answers from the database.  There are other LDAP gateways that
do similar things for other kinds of data anyway.  So then multiple
copies of NetteBook could be federated into the directory namespace
transparently.  The only remaining problem is how to replicate data
between the servers in an LDAP-compliant way, and I don't have a good
solution for that yet.</P>
<P>Oh of course there are rumors that PostgreSQL doesn't scale well enough.
If this becomes a problem I'm open to porting it to 
<a href=http://www.mysql.org/>MySQL</a> but I don't 
like MySQL's <a href=http://www.mysql.org/Manual_chapter/manual_Public_license.html#Public_license>licensing terms</a> as much.  
</P>
<P>No PIM is complete without multimedia.  Believe it
or not, you could actually OLE-embed anything you wanted into a Windows
3.1 cardfile, and one of my cardfiles consisted of WMF diagrams showing various
connector pinouts, for reference purposes.  I don't intend to decifer how
to un-embed the diagrams programmatically, but it illustrates the point 
that there is sometimes a need
for images.  The most classic example would be wanting to have a photo of
each contact, or a scanned business card.
The next question would be how to store the images, in BLOBs or files.
Personally I think since we're using a full-featured database, which might
or not reside on a <a href=filesystem.html>filesystem</a> 
10 years from now, why not use BLOBs.  The only 
scary thing is that PostgreSQL's BLOB support had better be stable.
As for UI, adding
multimedia to a contact will probably be done just like adding vcards,
via an HTTP upload.  I have to come up with a good way of distinguishing
images best shown inline from supplementary materials (home movies, say).
Probably via a form which will prompt for the caption, and 
a checkbox to say whether or not it should be an inline image, and
that form's submit button does the upload.</P>
<P>About the name:  It's your notebook on the 'net.  Its data can
funnel into the smallest browsers or PDAs thus the "ette" part (French
suffix meaning small).  Well the other reason for the "ette" is that
netbook.com seems to exist and 
I don't want to infringe any trademarks or anything.  This name is 
corny enough that infringement is improbable.  
Comparing it to a notebook is appropriate to its general purpose
nature.  Hopefully it will evolve towards storing things
in more suitably structured ways.</P>
<P>Concerning structure - my philosophy is that there is an optimum
amount of it for each personality.  I'm kindof messy and lazy sometimes;
I liked the Windows cardfile specifically for its lack of structure.
I'd get the benefits of electronic storage without the anal retentiveness
of a PIM (and anyway PIMs were a new concept and sucked even worse 
back then than now).  Similarly I don't see any point in breaking up
fields any more than necessary; so the actual phone number for example is a 
single field in its table.  (Having it in a separate table is only for
normalization purposes, to be flexible in allowing as many phone numbers
per person as you like.)  I don't have separate fields for country
code, area code, prefix, suffix, etc.  Those kinds of fields tend to
become obsolete anyway.  Similarly the person table has a lastname
field, and an othernames field.  I don't know how many names are
traditional in every country, so there's no point in having a middle
name field (or worse, constraining you to only a middle initial).
I only wanted to have the option of alphabetizing by last name, so
it had to be separate.  In general the goal of Nettebook is to
let you be as anal as you like, if you're so inclined, but not force
you into it.  I will probably always have a few lingering free-form
cards in my database.</P>
<P>This project deserves to be open source because it has been 
so long in coming.
