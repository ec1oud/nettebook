So far I've focused on wysiwyg; but some people like seeing Markdown syntax and
a preview side-by-side.  (In fact `QTextMarkdownWriter` still has enough bugs
that I have to do some kinds of editing operations in non-Qt applications.)

I'll try to have a flip-over view of markdown syntax in this zettelkasten.
