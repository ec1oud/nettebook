Hi, thanks for downloading NetteBook!

You can find out more about its purpose at www.nettebook.org.  Briefly 
it is a PIM, and so far the contact management features are the ones that
are implemented.  This is an alpha release, and it is free software.
There will not be any guarantees of any kind; use it at your own risk.
Please report any bugs you may find.

NetteBook has the following requirements:
o Web server capable of running PHP (developed on Apache)
o PHP3 scripting language installed as a module
o PostgreSQL database installed, and accessible to the UID that the 
  web server is running as

Soon it will probably require Java servlet support, but not in this release.

Directories under this one:
postgresql/	PostgreSQL setup info and SQL command files to create the 
		necessary tables
www/		HTML and PHP scripts which you should install in a 
		suitable directory accessible to your web server; for
		example on a Debian system, /var/www/nettebook
crd2sql/	A C program to convert legacy Windows .crd files for
		importing into NetteBook
