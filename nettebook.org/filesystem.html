I'm serious, I suspect filesystems may be obsolete some day.  They
may not be replaced by the relational database but maybe an object database.
Files are cumbersome; they require you to identify them by name and location
rather than other kinds of associations which might come more naturally
to you.  In this case, the user doesn't care what the filename of the
business card is, only what contact it's associated with.  But filesystems
may not be obsolete until they are replaced with OODBs/knowledgebases.
