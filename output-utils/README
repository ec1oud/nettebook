texprint is intended to be installed in /usr/local/bin and is useful
for direct printing when nettebook is used to generate a TeX file from 
a template.  It can accept TeX output directly from nettebook, convert
it to postscript, and queue it to your default printer.

In the manual directory are some utilities that may be useful when
nettebook is used to generate TeX or LyX output from a template, and
you want to download it, review it and print it by hand.  This 
situation often occurs when you want to print a batch of letters
or envelopes at once. 

Specifically:

BurstLyx.java and BurstTeX.java are used to separate ("burst")
a sequence of Lyx or TeX documents out into separate files.  In your
template, use a line like this:

%% file: <firstName/>-<lastName/>.tex

for TeX, or this:

#file: <firstName/>-<lastName/>.tex

and then if you merge a batch, every person's first and lastnames
will be substituted, and you can then use one of the "burst" programs
to find each of these "file" comments, break the output at that point,
and put it into a file with the name specified in the comment.

To use either burst utility, it's necessary to compile it first.
For example, 
javac BurstLyx.java
and to use it:
java BurstLyx

The "printall" shell script simply prints every .tex file in the 
current directory.
