0.5.0		Implemented "things" which are just non-person entities.
			All possible relationships are allowed between people and things.  
			Companies are now implemented as things; there is no "company"
			table anymore.  Added a mailmerge feature; it allowed me to address
			some envelopes with as little manual intervention as possible, but
			it is not complete yet, nor has the existing functionality been
			exhoustively tested yet.  You can create a "thing" representing a
			group of people, and for each person, create a "membership"
			relationship between the person and the group.  Then, you can
			mailmerge the list of people (with their families and addresses)
			with an arbitrary textual template.

0.4.0		First alpha
