So far I've focused on wysiwyg; but some people like seeing 
[Markdown syntax and a preview side-by-side](sync-QTextDocument-blocks-spans-with-source-range.md#two-pane_editor)
.  (In fact `QTextMarkdownWriter` still has enough bugs that I have to do some
kinds of editing operations in non-Qt applications.)

I'll try to have a flip-over view of markdown syntax in this zettelkasten.
