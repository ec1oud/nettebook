<H1>Release notes for Nettebook 0.4.0</H1>
<P>This is the first alpha release, on Oct. 28 1999.</P>
<P>What is implemented, is basic web-based contact management features.
I have been using the "cardfile" part for months now, and consider it 
stable, but it's also rather spartan-looking and needs some usability
and cosmetic kinds of improvements.  The ability to add 
people, companies, contact info, relationships, etc. are relatively
new and have been my focus for the last couple months.
There is a basic installation document which assumes you already
know how to install and configure apache, PHP and PostgreSQL and
just need help getting it to all work together.</P>
<P>The Palm conduit is not included yet; I spent some time on it but 
it is far too buggy and incomplete so far.</P>
<P>The schema is still far from stabilized.  I don't expect to 
make huge changes to what is there, but I do expect to make 
small modifications and add new tables and/or columns to support 
new features.</P>
<P>Well have fun, and please report your experiences with it on the
mailing list.</P>
