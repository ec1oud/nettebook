		An excerpt from the future JavaDocs:
		<P>Service an incoming connection by syncing the address databases.</P>
		<P>Strategy:</P><UL>
		<LI>If Postgres user.date is null, this indicates the database has never been
		synced with the PDA.  Assume there is no duplication of records between them
		(and if there is the user can weed out the dups later).</LI>
			<UL>
			<LI>Insert all records from the PDA into the database. (this is the part I have done so far)</LI>
			<LI>Update all existing PDA records to have the record ID equal to the 
			person entity ID in the database.  (That way when syncing in the future
			we can assume the record IDs are in this form.)</LI>
			<LI>Insert all existing records from the database into the PDA, not
			including the ones that were just inserted from the PDA into the 
			database.</LI>
			</UL>
		<LI>Else if the user.date is not null, we know when the last sync happened.  
		For each changed record in the PDA, however, we don't know what changed - 
		a contact method, or the person's name, or the company's name, or the note.
		For each changed record in the PDA:</LI>
			<UL>
			<LI>For every changed record relating to that person and/or company
			in the database, load the record into memory and hold it.</LI>
			<LI>If the note changed (test by comparing content), don't update it 
			because we don't know how much changed.  Instead insert a new record
			into the database.  Open issue: how does the user change the PDA
			note from the web interface?  When the sync process runs it can't
			tell whether the note was changed on the PDA or the web, only that
			they're different.  Well... I guess the database needs a last changed
			timestamp.</LI>
			<LI>Update the rest of the database records from the PDA record.</LI>
			<LI>Update both the database and the PDA from the records in memory.</LI>
			</UL>
		</UL>
		<P>So the individualized changes in the database override changes on the
		PDA, because we have more specific knowledge of what changed; but, other
		changes made on the PDA to a record are not lost.  Old notes are kept until
		the user deletes them via the web interface.  The primary_comment fields
		in the person and company tables indicate which of the comments is the
		PDA "note" field.  Similarly the primary_employer field in the person 
		table points to the company that should be shown with the person on 
		the PDA.</P>
